The words and the pictures, do they tell the full story? A story without a name, that only a lucky few know.

## About The Project

**Los Sueños de Samay (The Dreams of Samay)** is a multi-layered, interactive art piece that explores the synergy between the written word and generative visuals. It functions as a "living dream machine" where poetry is not static text, but a set of instructions that shape a dynamic, ever-changing dreamscape.

The user is invited to become a co-creator. By drawing directly on the canvas, triggering events by clicking on words, and even using their voice, they leave a persistent mark on the machine's memory. The aesthetic blends the cold, technical precision of a blueprint with the chaotic, beautiful, and ephemeral nature of a dream.

This project was born from an original collection of poetry and evolved through a collaborative process of refinement, resulting in a deeply personal yet universally resonant experience.

## Features

-   **Interactive Poetry:** Click on underlined words within the poems to trigger unique, corresponding visual events on the canvas.
-   **Multi-Layered Canvas System:** Utilizes four distinct canvases for persistent memory, active drawing, word particles, and user interaction, creating a sense of visual depth.
-   **Generative Drawing Entities:** Autonomous agents with unique behaviors (wandering, seeking, soaring) populate the canvas, ensuring the dreamscape is always alive.
-   **Persistent Memory:** All user drawings are saved to the browser's `localStorage`, creating a layered visual history that greets you on each return.
-   **Sound-Reactive Mode:** An optional mode using the Web Audio API allows the user's voice to generate new visual elements.
-   **Dynamic Gradient Rendering:** All lines are drawn with a smooth, procedural "twilight" gradient, giving the artwork a vibrant, liquid-like quality.
-   **Polished UI/UX:** Features a responsive glassmorphism UI, a pixel-perfect custom cursor with context-aware states, and an option to toggle the UI visibility to view the art unobstructed.

## How to Interact

1.  **Select a Poem:** Click on a title from the main menu to enter its dream.
2.  **Transform Words:** Click on the underlined words within the poem. Each has a unique effect.
3.  **Draw Your Memories:** Hold and drag the left mouse button to draw directly onto the canvas.
4.  **Toggle Visibility:** Click the **eye icon** in the top-right corner of the poem to hide the text panel and see the full canvas. **!!!**
5.  **Speak to Awaken:** Click the button in the bottom-left to enable the sound-reactive mode.
